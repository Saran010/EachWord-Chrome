##### Add new words when you watch movies, series or read books and they will be occasionally shown as push notifications.
The best practice to remember new words is to hang the cards with the words on a prominent spot. That spot in your computer is your browser. You can add new words found when you learn new language into your personal dictionary and then they will be occasionally shown either as beautiful cards at the top of the browser blurring your current website in order to you pay attention or as Notification when your browser is closed. When word is learned just delete it from dictionary and add new one.
